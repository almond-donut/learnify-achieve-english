**Agent:** Agent_Gamification
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 / Task A / Achievement System Setup

**Summary:**
Completed initial setup and enhancement of the achievement system with real-time notifications and progress monitoring.

**Details:**
- Enhanced existing useGamification hook with improved achievement checking logic
- Implemented server-side achievement validation via RPC functions with fallback to client-side validation
- Added comprehensive achievement types: first_login, streak_master, quiz_champion, consistent_learner, knowledge_seeker
- Integrated real-time toast notifications for achievement unlocks using react-hot-toast
- Added proper error handling and loading states for achievement operations
- Implemented points awarding system with database updates via Supabase

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Enhanced useGamification hook with achievement checking
const checkAchievements = useCallback(async (context: AchievementContext) => {
  try {
    // Try server-side RPC first
    const { data: serverResult, error } = await supabase.rpc('check_user_achievements', {
      p_user_id: user.id,
      p_context: context
    });

    if (!error && serverResult) {
      return serverResult;
    }

    // Fallback to client-side validation
    const newAchievements = await validateAchievementsClientSide(context);
    return newAchievements;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Achievement check failed:', error);
    return [];
  }
}, [user?.id]);
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None - Achievement system is fully functional with both server-side and client-side validation.

**Next Steps:**
Proceed to streak management system implementation and level progression features.
