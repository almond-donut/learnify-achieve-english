**Agent:** Agent_Memory
**Task Reference:** Phase 2 / Task C / Memory System Implementation

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive memory bank system with React components, context provider, and integration with existing gamification features.

**Details:**
- Created memory bank database schema with tables for memory_entries, learning_patterns, context_sessions, and memory_recommendations
- Implemented vector embeddings support using pgvector extension for semantic similarity search
- Built comprehensive React context provider (MemoryProvider) for memory management with localStorage persistence
- Created MemoryDashboard component with tabs for memories, insights, and patterns visualization
- Enhanced useGamification hook with memory integration for achievement tracking and learning context recording
- Added memory system to student dashboard with dedicated route and navigation
- Integrated memory provider into main App.tsx component hierarchy
- Implemented RLS policies and database functions for secure memory operations

**Output/Result:**
```typescript
// Memory Context Provider with localStorage persistence
export const MemoryProvider: React.FC<MemoryProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const [memories, setMemories] = useState<MemoryEntry[]>([]);
  const [patterns, setPatterns] = useState<LearningPattern[]>([]);

  const addMemory = (type: string, content: any, tags: string[] = [], importance: number = 0.5) => {
    const newMemory: MemoryEntry = {
      id: `memory_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
      type, content, tags, importance,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    setMemories(prev => [newMemory, ...prev].slice(0, 100));
  };

  const recordLearningSession = (activityType: string, performance: any, duration: number) => {
    // Records session in memory and updates learning patterns
    addMemory('learning_session', { activityType, performance, duration }, 
      [activityType, 'session'], performance.score > 0.8 ? 0.8 : 0.5);
  };
};

// Enhanced Gamification Hook with Memory Integration
const recordQuizCompletion = async (quizData: {
  score: number; correct_answers: number; time_taken: number; total_questions: number;
}) => {
  const performance = {
    score: quizData.score,
    accuracy: quizData.correct_answers / quizData.total_questions,
    time_per_question: quizData.time_taken / quizData.total_questions
  };
  
  recordLearningSession('quiz_completion', performance, quizData.time_taken);
  addMemory('quiz_result', { ...quizData, performance }, ['quiz', 'assessment'], 
    performance.score > 0.8 ? 0.8 : 0.6);
  
  await checkAchievements({ activityType: 'quiz', performance, duration: quizData.time_taken });
};

// Memory Dashboard Component
export const MemoryDashboard: React.FC = ({ onGenerateInsights }) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'memories' | 'insights' | 'patterns'>('memories');
  // Displays recent learning memories, personalized insights, and learning patterns
  // with visual cards showing importance scores, context tags, and timestamps
};
```

**Status:** Completed

**Issues/Blockers:**
None - Memory system is fully functional with both database backend and localStorage fallback for offline operation.

**Next Steps:**
Proceed to Task D - Agentic Project Management Integration for intelligent tutoring capabilities.
